Experienced Software Engineer with over 12 years in the field, proficient in JavaScript and CSS since 2009. Former instructor in Chile with a passion for programming and ongoing learning. Skilled in frontend and backend technologies, cloud platforms, DevOps, testing, and UI design. Strong collaborator and leader, adept at mentoring team members and crafting robust project architectures.


ðŸ“Œ Frontend: As a senior developer, I excel in independently constructing SPAs, SSRs (using Nuxt.js/Next.js), and micro-frontend approaches with webpack federated modules. Proficient in React and Vue, I specialize in crafting and defining frontend library architectures using tools like Turbo-Repo, Lerna, Rollup, and others.
 
ðŸ“Œ Backend: I began my career with PHP, then transitioned to JEE, and spent four years working with .NET MVC. This diverse experience has given me a deep understanding of different backend setups, including technologies like Node.js and microservices using Spring Boot, among others. Databases such as Postgres, MySQL, Supabase, Firebase and DynamoDB are frequently leveraged in my projects.

ðŸ“Œ DevOps: I have practical experience with multiple cloud platforms, including Azure, AWS, and GCP. I am also familiar with GitOps, Helm charts, Docker, and ArgoCD. My knowledge includes understanding CI/CD pipelines and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

ðŸ“Œ Testing: Testing is an integral part of my daily routine, where I proficiently conduct end-to-end (e2e) and unit tests. I utilize tools such as Cypress, Vitest, Testing Library, and other related testing frameworks to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

ðŸ“Œ UI: My workflow typically involves working with Figma to meticulously craft pixel-perfect components within frontend frameworks. I'm adept at utilizing UI Libraries like MUI, Tailwind, Oruga, and other headless libraries. Additionally, I'm capable of constructing designs either from scratch using plain CSS/SASS (BEM or other standards) technologies, under React I can do styled components or CSS modules.

ðŸ“Œ Additional Skills: In addition to my expertise with Unix systems and my daily use of tmux and vim, I am adept with Git and various command-line tools. Furthermore, I actively contribute to team efforts by providing reviews, assisting colleagues with my experience, and taking on leadership roles to develop foundational project architectures.
